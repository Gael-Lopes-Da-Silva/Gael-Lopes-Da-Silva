<p align="center">✨ I'm currently a 18-year-old French student. My main goal is to comprehend the dark magic behind programming complex system and I'm passionate about code that's behind OS, application, IA and more.</p>

<p align="center">❤️ I love learning new things like game development, server development, GUI app development or web design/development... I really like creating my own things and polish them.</p>
