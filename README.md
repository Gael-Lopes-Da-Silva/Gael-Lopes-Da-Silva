<p align="center">✨ I'm a 18-years-old French student. I'm passionate about programming and scripting. I want to learn programming. Not just using libraries but also things more complex like creating my own libraries.</p>

<p align="center">❤️ I love learning new things like game development, server development, GUI app development or web design/development... I really like creating my own things and polish them.</p>
