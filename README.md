✨ I'm currently a student, studying in French. My main gaol is to comprehend the dark magic behind programming. I'm passionate about code that's behind OS, application, IA and more. 

❤️ I love learning new things like game developpement, server developpement, GUI app developpement or web design / developpement and more... I realy like creating my own things and polish them to the end.
